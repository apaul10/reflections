When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote would be most effective when working in a team, or when you may operate from multiple devices, and you may need to access content created by you or others directly from GitHub

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

this is critical to ensure you have control over the types of updates or code changes that happpen when working on your projects
