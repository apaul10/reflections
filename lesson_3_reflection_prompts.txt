When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote would be most effective when working in a team, or when you may operate from multiple devices, and you may need to access content created by you or others directly from GitHub

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

this is critical to ensure you have control over the types of updates or code changes that happpen when working on your projects

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are used when creating new features, or fixing bugs, or when making changes that should not affect the master branch. A clone is used to copy a repositiory, either between git and github or from another location. Fork should be used when you do not have permissions to modify a repository, and to also give credit to the original source of the repository
