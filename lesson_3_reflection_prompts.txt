When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote would be most effective when working in a team, or when you may operate from multiple devices, and you may need to access content created by you or others directly from GitHub

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

this is critical to ensure you have control over the types of updates or code changes that happpen when working on your projects

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are used when creating new features, or fixing bugs, or when making changes that should not affect the master branch. A clone is used to copy a repositiory, either between git and github or from another location. Fork should be used when you do not have permissions to modify a repository, and to also give credit to the original source of the repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This helps to identify and resolve conflicts when updated commits are ahead, behind, out of date or out of sync with what is currently online

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Communication would mean alot of emails, using one file at a time, and potential chaos and time wasted waiting on on file to be free for editing. Git and GitHub makes collaboration easier, as mulitple persons can use the same files and make different changes all at the same time, and merge them at a later date, resolving any conflicts that are present

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

This should be done when creating new features, or making alterations or alternative options to what already exists in the master branch. Having branches helps to keep features and functionality in a centralized place where they can be merged at a leter date once agreed on.
