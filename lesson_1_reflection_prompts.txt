How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed only where changes were made, and made it easier to identify where a difference existed, hence making finding bugs easier.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    This provides the ability to rollback an application to any previous version to help identify bugs, or to rollback features.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual commits allow you to group all logical changes together, while automatic commits may not be the most effective when trying to identify bugs, or changes made in builk.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Not all files are related, and will determine if they should be committed together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows you all the changes that have been made, and git diff shows the difference between file versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    it is comforting to know that once the solution is working, then you can always revert to a previous version and identify the code that triggered the error

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I may use it to access repositories online, and open files using the sublime text editor
